Project Title: Ice Cream Truck Simulator

Description: This is an ice cream truck simulator that allows the user to add
employees, add flavors, sell ice cream to customers, and check the truck's cashbox.
This is an assignment that I created in one of my computer science classes.

Languages used: Java(Object Oriented Programming)

For this project, I created 4 classes: Employee.java, Flavor.java, Cashbox.java,
add IceCreamTruck.java. Please find information about each class below:

Employee.java- This is a Employees class with attributes, getters, and setters.
When the program runs, the user is able to add employees and give them certain
permissions, to drive the truck, to work the cash register, or both.

Flavor.java -This is a Ice cream flavor class with getters, setters, and attributes.
When the program runs, the user is able to add flavors and create new flavors.

Cashbox.java-This is a cashbox class that keeps track of all monetary things that
that have to do with the ice cream truck. This includes: the starting cash,
the amount of ice cream sold, the amount of cash inside of the truck, the expected
sales, and profit.

IceCreamTruck.java-  This is the class that contains the main method that runs the
entire program. It contains two array lists: employees and flavors. After an employee
or flavor object is created, it is added to the appropriate ArrayList.

Building this project, I face many challenges. Some of those include: find a way
for the user to be able to assign employees to be the driver in the cashier,
user input validation, and computing all the values for the cashbox. In the future,
I would like to find a way to fire employees if the money comes up short. To do
this, I will add in random scenarios that will change impact the amount of money
in the cashbox.

To run this project, compile the IceCreamTruck.java class and run it in the
terminal.
